**TITLE: AI-Assisted Pharmacogenomic Prescription Safety**



**--------------------------------------------------**



**INTRO (20 sec)**



**Today incorrect prescriptions still happen because genetics is ignored.**

**Two patients can receive the same drug but respond completely differently.**



**Our system reads a patient’s genomic VCF file and predicts drug safety before the medicine is given.**



**We demonstrate a real clinical scenario.**



**--------------------------------------------------**



**CASE (40 sec)**



**A cardiology patient is prescribed Clopidogrel after a stent procedure.**



**However the patient carries a CYP2C19 loss-of-function variant.**



**Normally this information is hidden inside a raw genome file and never checked in routine practice.**



**We upload the genomic VCF into our system.**



**(System upload here)**



**--------------------------------------------------**



**ANALYSIS (40 sec)**



**The system parses variants, identifies pharmacogenomic genes, and maps them to metabolic phenotype.**



**Here it detects:**

**Gene: CYP2C19**

**Phenotype: Poor Metabolizer**



**Now we evaluate the prescribed drug.**



**(Result screen visible)**



**The system predicts:**

**Risk: Ineffective Therapy**



**--------------------------------------------------**



**CLINICAL REASONING (40 sec)**



**Clopidogrel is a prodrug and requires CYP2C19 activation.**

**Because activation fails, the patient receives little antiplatelet effect.**



**This significantly increases risk of stent thrombosis.**



**The system therefore recommends an alternative therapy.**



**--------------------------------------------------**



**DECISION SUPPORT (30 sec)**



**Instead of raw genetic data, the clinician receives:**



**• risk category**

**• biological explanation**

**• actionable recommendation**



**This converts genomic data into a medical decision.**



**--------------------------------------------------**



**IMPACT (20 sec)**



**Our system prevents adverse drug reactions and treatment failure before they occur.**



**It transforms genomic sequencing from passive data into active prescription safety.**
