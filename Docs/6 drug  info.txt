🧬 What your system is doing (big picture)

Your app reads a patient’s DNA file (VCF) and looks for specific genetic differences in 6 important genes that control how the body handles certain medicines.

These genes affect:
✅ how fast a drug is activated
✅ how quickly it is removed
✅ how strongly it acts
✅ whether side effects happen

If a gene works differently → the drug response changes.

🧪 The 6 Critical Pharmacogenes (Easy Guide)
1️⃣ CYP2D6 — Drug activation speed controller

What it does: Converts some medicines into their active form.

Why it matters

Too slow → drug doesn’t work

Too fast → overdose risk

Important drug: Codeine

Example
Some people cannot convert codeine into morphine → no pain relief.

2️⃣ CYP2C19 — Drug activation enzyme

What it does: Activates certain heart and stomach medications.

Why it matters

Low activity → drug ineffective

Normal activity → drug works

Important drug: Clopidogrel

Example
If CYP2C19 is weak, clopidogrel cannot prevent blood clots properly.

3️⃣ CYP2C9 — Drug breakdown controller

What it does: Helps remove drugs from the body.

Why it matters

Slow metabolism → drug builds up → toxicity

Important drug: Warfarin

Example
Slow CYP2C9 → higher bleeding risk at normal dose.

4️⃣ SLCO1B1 — Drug transport protein

What it does: Moves drugs from blood into liver.

Why it matters

Poor transport → drug stays in bloodstream

High drug levels → side effects

Important drug: Simvastatin

Example
Low SLCO1B1 function → muscle damage risk.

5️⃣ TPMT — Drug detox enzyme

What it does: Deactivates certain chemotherapy and immune drugs.

Why it matters

Low activity → toxic drug buildup

Important drug: Azathioprine

Example
Low TPMT → severe bone marrow toxicity.

6️⃣ DPYD — Drug clearance enzyme

What it does: Breaks down chemotherapy drug fluorouracil.

Why it matters

Deficiency → life-threatening toxicity

Important drug: Fluorouracil

Example
DPYD deficiency → drug cannot be cleared → severe reaction.

🔬 What “identifying variants” means

Each gene has many possible versions.
Your system checks if the patient has:

✔ normal function
✔ reduced function
✔ no function
✔ increased function

This determines the patient’s drug metabolism type.

🧠 How this helps doctors

Instead of guessing, doctors can know:

Will the drug work?

Should dose be reduced?

Is another drug safer?

So treatment becomes personalized medicine.

Your system scans genetic variants in six key drug-response genes to predict whether a medication will be safe, ineffective, or toxic for an individual patient.
